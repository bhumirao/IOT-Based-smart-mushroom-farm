# IOT-Based-smart-mushroom-farm
The project aims at automating the labor work during mushroom plantation by using iot sensors and actuators  . we used DHT11 sensor and the LDR sensor for 
checking the temperature and the light intensity conditions , as mushrooms need controlled environment we also used an humidity sensor which was there on board with the DHT mechansim .
